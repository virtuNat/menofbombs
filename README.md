It's bomberman with like a little bit of a twist because I felt slightly ambitious

When one player gets blasted, they lose the ability to place bombs and become a ghost. A ghost fruit appears at this point -- the ghost player must reach it before the other player hits them again with their new empowered bombs! If the ghost player reaches the ghost fruit, they come back to life. To win, you must double kill the ghost player.

CONTROLS:

wasd, e - movement and bomb placement for player 1

arrow keys, l - movement and bomb placement for player 2

P.S.: This is really bad don't play it

P.P.S.: You're gonna need to have pygame installed to run this
